# open-cluster-with-DBSCAN

<p align = "justify">  In this workshop, we will determine the cluster members of an open cluster using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). The open cluster data that will be used is NGC 752 from Gaia Early Data Release 3 (eDR3). </p> 

## 1. Introduction

<p align = "justify"> Open clusters have long been regarded as powerful tools for studies of the Galactic disk and evolution of stars (Chen, 2003). Membership determination is the first step to study an open cluster, which can directly influence estimation of physical parameters. Various methods have been used for membership determination based on proper motions, radial velocities, photometric data and their combination.
</p>
<p align = "justify"> Various algorithms have been developed for the determination of star cluster membership. Machine-learning applications for this case were introduced such as DBSCAN (Gao, 2014), Gaussian Mixture Model (Gao, 2020), KMEANS (El Aziz et al. 2016), k-th nearest neighbor (Gao, 2016), ML-MOC (Agarwal et al. 2021) and many more.
