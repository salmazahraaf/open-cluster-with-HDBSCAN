# open-cluster-with-DBSCAN

<p align = "justify">  In this workshop, we will determine the cluster members of an open cluster using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). The open cluster data that will be used is NGC 752 from Gaia Early Data Release 3 (eDR3). </p>
